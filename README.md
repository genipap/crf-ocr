# Optical Character Recognition with Conditional Random Field

This project is part of the Advanced Topics in Statistical Machine Learning course at ANU. The system is built upon a mathematically defined graphical model, and is able to learn to recognise handwritten characters from given training examples. With the UPenn OCR dataset, the system achieved a letter-wise classification accuracy above 80% and a word-wise classification accuracy of almost 50%.
